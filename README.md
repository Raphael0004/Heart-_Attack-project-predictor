# Heart-_Attack-project-predictor
Heart-Disease Project
This project aims to develop a predictive model for assessing the possibility of heart disease in patients based on various demographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors. The model utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze a dataset containing features such as age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol levels, electrocardiogram results, and other relevant parameters. 

By leveraging this predictive model, healthcare systems can proactively identify individuals at higher risk of heart disease and provide timely interventions and personalized care, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing the burden on healthcare resources. PROJECT OVERVIEW The project follows a structured approach to data analysis and model development, encompassing the following key steps:

DATA COLLECTION;The dataset containingS patients info, including demographic details, medical history, and diagnostic test results, is obtained from reliable sources or repositories such as Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository. DATA PROCESSING: The raw dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS: Comprehensive EDA is conducted to gain insights into the distribution of features, identify correlations, and understand patterns within the data. Visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices are utilized to facilitate exploration.

FAETURE SELECTION: Relevant features are selected based on their importance and impact on predicting heart disease status.

MODEL DEVELOPMENT: Various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and gradient boosting are implemented to build predictive models. Hyper-parameter tuning and cross-validation techniques are utilized to optimize model performance.

MODEL EVELUATION: The performance of the trained models is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy and precision.
Deployment and intergration: The final predictive model is deployed in a production environment, integrated into existing healthcare systems or applications, and made accessible for real-time predictions. Model outputs are interpreted and communicated effectively to healthcare professionals for clinical decision-making.

RESULT:  After thorough data analysis and model development, the predictive model achieves an accuracy of 89% in predicting heart disease status. This high level of accuracy demonstrates the effectiveness of the model in identifying individuals at risk of heart disease. The model's performance is further validated through rigorous evaluation and comparison with baseline models, showcasing its robustness and reliability.
